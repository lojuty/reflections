When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When working with tablets, or on a temoporary computers where I have no time (or permissions) to install git.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* I might have been working off line for some time and I do now want code any files overwritten accidentaly or in process of a merge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

* branch is inside a repository in a single server/location
* clone is a copy between servers/locations
* fork is a clone, that leaves a trace of the origin and destination, in GitHub
